            <!-- HOW TO USE -->
            <section id="interactive">
                <h2>Interactive</h2>
                <p>Crack open this HTML file in a code editor (I happen to like <a target="_blank" href="https://brackets.io/">Brackets</a>, but you can use plain old Notepad if you want.)</p>
                <h3>Under the Hood</h3>
                <p>At the top is some technical stuff, then some embedding stuff like <span class="mono">meta-og-title</span> and etcetera. These are pieces that will show up in the embed card when you link to this site on Bluesky or Discord or somewhere. You can include an image too, but you don't need to use any of this chunk if you don't want. (<a target="_blank" href="https://ogp.me/">More info on meta tags</a>)</p>
                <p>Then you'll see the <span class="mono">&lt;style&gt;</span> section. This is where the CSS lives and gives the website its visual style. CSS is capable of a lot of crazy tricks (especially if you want to avoid learning Javascript), but it's also pretty easy to figure out. I love and highly recommend the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS">Mozilla CSS guide</a> for learning what you can do.</p>
                <p>The HTML content is cut up into <span class="mono">&lt;section&gt;</span>s, each of which has an ID. This is how this website manages multiple pages, by using the <span class="mono">:target</span> selector and "anchor links," which are links to a specific element on a page instead of a different page. Otherwise the HTML in here is pretty basic&mdash;just headers and paragraphs and links&mdash;so it should be pretty simple to figure out, especially if you've ever inspected element on Wikipedia to get a fake screenshot for a gag.</p>
                <p>You can embed images and stuff with <span class="mono">img</span> tags and a URL, either to an image in the same folder as this HTML file or to an external host like imgur. It's good manners to use <span class="mono">loading=lazy</span> on images, especially if they're not on the homepage so they're not visible right away.</p>

                    <!-- I definitely could make images + captions contained this way without the extra div (to save a little typing if I was making a page with a ton of them) but this is fine + gives you more options for styling them as a unit. -->

                <p>HTML, like all programming, is a process of pasting other people's code off forums into your own project until it does what you want. A lot of places (Youtube, etc.) will even give you embeddable HTML you can plop right into your own site. Check this out:</p>
                <div class="inline">
                    <iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 18em;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1518073511/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=small/transparent=true?ignore/" seamless><a href="https://disasteradio.bandcamp.com/album/buy-now-deluxe-edition?ignore">BUY NOW (Deluxe Edition) by Eyeliner</a></iframe>
                    <!--you can't do much to an iframe (embedded piece of a different site) for security reasons but you can at least choose what size it is-->
                </div>
                <p>Anyway. I'm not going to write a whole "Learning Basic HTML" guide in here. Just mess around with it and see what breaks. HTML elements are nested boxes and they have IDs or classes (or are just standard types of thing) that get referred to in the CSS and painted according to those rules. If you're smart, you can use combinations of classes to make writing and typesetting a breeze. Or, if you're like me, you can slap together some big mess and hope nobody peeks under the hood.</p>

                <p>Getting your site public is easier and cheaper than ever. You will probably want to use <a target="_blank" href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a>, which is very user-friendly and well-documented. They offer a paid plan with extra storage and some other neat features, but you can make something totally fleshed-out with the couple gigabytes you get for free. Neocities also has an in-browser code editor and file manager, which is so sick when you upload a page and realize there's a typo in it.</p>
                <p>If you want to set out on your own, I use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> for all my sites. Netlify is a little intimidating because it's meant for businesses, so it'll show you a bunch of popups about A/B testing and node functions and other nerd stuff. But that also means it's free to use as a regular person, so I just ignore all those and drag &amp; drop my little folders.</p>
                <p>Anyway, using either of these services is pretty straightforward, especially for a one-file site like this one. Rename it to <span class="mono">index.html</span>, upload it, and you're rolling.</p>
                <p>There are also mysterious and ancient ways to <a target="_blank" href="https://httpd.apache.org/">host your website on your own hardware</a>, but this is a kind of advanced project that you should only pursue if you need to self-host for a technical reason, or if you're looking for an annoying thing to spend a weekend on.</p>
                <h3>Short Films</h3>
                <p>A custom domain name is cool but totally optional. It does cost some money, depending where you buy it&mdash;I use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>, people also like <a target="_blank" href="https://porkbun.com/">Porkbun</a>&mdash;but regardless of who you go through you can typically get one for about 10 bucks a year, or even less if it's a <a target="_blank" href="https://purpletoilet.com">goofy domain nobody else wants</a>.</p>
                <p>To hook up a vanity URL to your site, you'll have to do some stuff with DNS records. This process is slightly different for every domain broker, so just look for the instructions on the service you chose. I believe in you.</p>

                <h2>Misc</h2>
                <p>I know I just said I'm not writing a whole guide to HTML, but here are a few tricks and tools I've found useful:</p>
                <h3>Tools</h3>
                <p><a target="_blank" href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/">Eric Meyer's CSS reset</a> is a stylesheet that will reset all the weird annoying default properties some HTML elements have. Keep in mind that stylesheets are applied in the order they're linked.</p>
                <p><a target="_blank" href="https://grid.layoutit.com/">LayoutIt</a> is a great tool for making CSS grids and flexboxes and stuff. I love a CSS grid but remembering all the right syntax is a pain. So just use this.</p>
                <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cssmatic.com/">CSSmatic</a> has some nice generators for things like gradients and shadows, which are also annoying to try and make by typing code.</p>
                <p><a target="_blank" href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> has a ton of open-source typefaces that are really easy to embed and use on your webpage. Some of them are even good!</p>
                <p><a target="_blank" href="https://squoosh.app/">Squoosh</a> is a tool for compressing images, which is handy if you're hosting them somewhere like Neocities with a storage cap. Or you could go old-school:</p>
                <p><a target="_blank" href="https://doodad.dev/dither-me-this/">Dither Me This</a> is for dithering images, which compresses them way more and looks cooler than JPEG compression. <a target="_blank" href="https://ditherit.com/">Dither It!</a> is a similar tool that gives you more options.</p>
                <h3>Tips</h3>
                <p>It's good manners to include <span class="mono">target="_blank"</span> on links to an external site. This makes the link open in a new tab.</p>
                <p>CSS has a lot of features meant to make your site more accessible. Use them! Images have an <span class="mono">alt=""</span> tag for description text. <span class="mono">@media</span> queries can check a user's preferences for contrast and input device.</p>
                <p>Margin goes outside of a box. Padding goes between the box and its contents. Temporarily giving an element a bright background color or border can help you figure out where its edges are.</p>
                <p>Some special characters (&lt; and &gt;, etc.) need to be typed in HTML as something else or the computer will choke on them. For example, &amp; is encoded as <span class="mono">&amp;amp;</span>. This is dumb but what are you gonna do.</p>
                <p>An <span class="mono">em</span> is a unit about the size of a capital X in regular body text. It's good to use ems instead of pixels for sizing &amp; moving things so they look right on more screens.</p>
                <p>The most important tip is to have fun :)</p>

                <h2>Hello!</h2>
                <p>This one-page style of website does allow you to have sections that don't appear in the nav, since you choose what to type up there. But it's still all visible in the source, so it's a bad hiding place.</p>
